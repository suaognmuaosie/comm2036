        <h1 class="title">What's the Cost of Mars Migration?</h1>
        
        <div class="content-section">
            <p>
                Imagine packing for a big move. Now, instead of moving to a new city, you’re moving to a whole new planet. Oh, and you’ll need to take a million tons of stuff with you—everything from bulldozers to potato seeds. That’s Elon Musk’s vision for a self-sustaining Mars colony, and spoiler alert: it’s not cheap.
            </p>

            <h2>A Galactic Price Tag</h2>
            <div class="image-section">
                <img src="cost4.jpg" alt="Mars Costs Overview" loading="lazy">
            </div>
            <p>
                At today’s rates, moving a million tons to Mars would cost over $1,000 trillion. Yes, trillion with a T. That’s more money than the entire U.S. GDP, and probably more than Jeff Bezos’s Amazon cart during a Black Friday spree. Clearly, this isn’t the kind of bill you just put on your credit card.
            </p>
            <p>
                Elon Musk, however, has a plan to turn that trillion-dollar headache into a more manageable price tag. His goal? Bring costs down by a factor of 1,000. Easy, right? Well, not quite.
            </p>

            <h2>The Starship Solution</h2>
            <div class="image-section">
                <img src="starship4.png" alt="Starship Cost Saving" loading="lazy">
            </div>
            <p>
                Musk’s secret weapon in this cosmic cost-cutting mission is SpaceX’s Starship rocket. Think of it as a super-sized, reusable space shuttle on steroids. Unlike the single-use rockets of yore, Starship is designed to be fully reusable, much like a plane. Musk envisions slashing the cost of a Starship launch to under $10 million within the next few years. That’s cheaper than a Hollywood blockbuster—and infinitely cooler.
            </p>
            <p>
                If all goes well, this could bring the cost of Mars-bound cargo down to something that won’t make accountants faint. Musk has even suggested that colonizing Mars might someday cost $25 billion—a steal compared to today’s estimates.
            </p>

            <h2>But Wait, There’s More (Challenges)</h2>
            <div class="image-section">
                <img src="mars_environment.jpg" alt="Challenges of Mars Costs" loading="lazy">
            </div>
            <p>
                While Musk’s optimism is infectious, experts point out some, shall we say, minor details that need sorting out. First, life support systems have to keep people alive in an environment that’s as welcoming as Antarctica in space. Then, there’s the need for Mars-based manufacturing, because let’s face it: shipping everything from Earth is like ordering groceries from across the ocean.
            </p>
            <p>
                And even if we manage all that, there’s the big question: How will Mars pay for itself? Sure, the Red Planet might be a great spot for Instagram selfies, but it’s not clear what its economy would look like. Mining? Tourism? Intergalactic souvenir shops? The jury’s still out.
            </p>

            <h2>So, Is It Possible?</h2>
            <div class="image-section">
                <img src="mars_city.jpg" alt="Future Mars Colony Costs" loading="lazy">
            </div>
            <p>
                In theory, yes. Musk’s dream of a Mars colony is ambitious, audacious, and expensive—but not impossible. With reusable rockets and technological advances, what once seemed like science fiction is inching closer to reality. However, the road to Mars is paved with big questions and bigger price tags.
            </p>
            <p>
                For now, Musk is betting that with innovation and determination, we can turn Mars from a distant dream into humanity’s second home. And who knows? Maybe one day, you’ll be booking your Mars vacation on SpaceX.com. Just make sure your luggage is under the weight limit—shipping fees to Mars are no joke.
